# videocompression

The code was only tested with image compression as the project itself did not compile correctly. The project code has been adjusted for it to run separatly when dct mode is selected

The usage of it is as follows:
./run.sh dct {set quality in double digits 0-100} {value not taken into account}

The code was adjusted to specifically take into account a different mode as the encoding and compression is done differently than it was with other modes
